# dcmview

Open local DICOM files and folders in `dcmview` directly from VS Code.

`dcmview` is a fast, temporary DICOM inspection tool for research and
development workflows. The extension starts a local loopback `dcmview` server
from the selected file or folder and displays the viewer in a VS Code webview.

`dcmview` is intended for developer and research inspection, not clinical
diagnosis.

## Supported Platforms

Marketplace builds currently bundle `dcmview` binaries for:

- Linux x64
- macOS x64
- macOS arm64
- Windows x64

On unsupported platforms, or when you need to test a locally built binary, set
`dcmview.binaryPath` to an absolute path to a compatible `dcmview` executable.

## Usage

Use the Explorer context menu command `Open with dcmview` on DICOM files or
folders. The extension launches `dcmview --no-browser --port 0`, waits for the
local server URL, and opens the viewer beside your current editor.

For files named `*.dcm`, `*.dicom`, or `*.ima`, use VS Code's `Reopen With...`
command and choose `dcmview` to open the file in a readonly dcmview editor tab.
Set `dcmview` as the default editor for those patterns if you want double-clicks
to open matching DICOM files directly in dcmview. Extensionless DICOM files and
folders should still use the Explorer context menu command.

The command `dcmview: Open Workspace with dcmview` opens a selected workspace
folder. The command `dcmview: Stop All dcmview Sessions` terminates extension
managed viewer sessions.

When `dcmview.terminalInterception.enabled` is true, new integrated terminals
route `dcmview`, `dcmview-py`, and `python -m dcmview_py` invocations into VS
Code webview panels. Set `DCMVIEW_VSCODE_BYPASS=1` in a terminal to bypass that
integration for a single shell session.

## Settings

- `dcmview.binaryPath`: absolute path to a `dcmview` binary override.
- `dcmview.defaultRecursive`: recursively scan selected folders by default.
- `dcmview.extraArgs`: additional command-line arguments passed to `dcmview`.
- `dcmview.startupTimeoutSeconds`: seconds to wait for startup.
- `dcmview.terminalInterception.enabled`: route integrated terminal launches
  into VS Code webviews.
